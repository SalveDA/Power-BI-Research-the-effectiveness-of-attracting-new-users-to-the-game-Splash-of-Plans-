<h1 align="center">Research on the effectiveness of attracting new users to the game Splash of Plans</a>

####

**TASK:**

Understand which channels of attraction are effective and ineffective in the LTV metric, and track the dynamics of this metric.  

To do this, you need to answer two questions:
1. Which campaigns are the most effective and the most ineffective?
2. What is the daily performance dynamics of these companies?  

**This report uses a model for calculating LTV at certain time cut-offs, namely LTV on the 30th day*

<br/>
<br/>

**CONCLUSION:**

According to the results of the study , three of the most effective campaigns can be identified:

1. ***"rus_search_brand-discount-15"***
2. ***"rus_search_brand-discount-10"***
3. ***"rus_search_gen-flow-discount-10-night"***


and the three least effective campaigns:

1. ***"ukr_search_gen-discount-15"***
2. ***"rus_search_gen-vlozhenye-zaprosy-phones-discount-15"***
3. ***"rus_search_gen-phones-discount-10-night"***


**Recommendations:**

Stop the action of campaigns that bring losses and conduct an analysis to identify the reasons for their low performance. It is also worth paying attention to the unstable dynamics of LTV indicators in successful companies and conduct additional research in order to identify the reasons for this kind of trend and bring performance indicators to a stable high level.
